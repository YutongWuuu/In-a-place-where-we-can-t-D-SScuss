This project aims to explore the mindset of individuals on Chinese social media platforms who fear inadvertently triggering sensitive words when posting information. I use the form of a Minesweeper game to depict how people carefully consider their words like navigating a minefield, replacing banned words with "*" symbols to avoid account suspension due to frequent use of sensitive words.
